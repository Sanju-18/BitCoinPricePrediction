# BitCoinPricePrediction
Prediction method involves machine learning algorithms like KNN, Naive Bayes and random forest. When considering about data, we have used latest dataset (2017-2021) for prediction. 
<h2> Naive Bayes</h2>
  Naive Bayes works on the bayes theorm where the attributes of the dataset are independent of each other and finding the conditional probability over them. 
  
<h2> KNN </h2>
  K- nearest neighbour is finding the nearest neighbour for the given datapoint over the datapoints spread amoung the space (dataset).

<h2> Random Forest </h2>
  Random forest mutitudes the decision tree and combines results from the trees which would helpful for predicting the values.
